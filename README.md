# EMIT
## What's this?
EMIT is my first ever public game released.
Back then (in 2020) I had this cool idea of a puzzle game where you have to
rewind time to solve puzzles. There are many things I would do differently,
were I to remake the game, however, there are many things I am proud of.

The game has localization features, easy to setup puzzle elements, and an unfinished multiplayer co-op mode.
